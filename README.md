# Resilience Stack

**18 strategy frameworks for positioning that holds under pressure.**

Curated by [Petrichor Projects](https://petrichorgrowth.com). Built from our workshop catalog. Each skill = 50+ hours of framework engineering, packaged as a Claude Code skill you can run in 2.5 hours.

Not comprehensive. Curated. No filler.

## How To Run A Skill

Inside Claude Code:

```
> /skill positioning-under-pressure
```

Or invoke directly via the `Skill` tool with `skill: "positioning-under-pressure"`.

Each skill is an interactive facilitator. It runs the workshop phase-by-phase, asks pressure-test questions, scores responses, writes deliverables to `./<skill-name>-output/`.

Typical session: 2-3 hours. Output: 5 deliverables per workshop.

---

## What You Need First

Each skill lists pre-work in its `PHASE 1`. Common requirements:

- 4 quarters of revenue data (segment, channel, cohort)
- Win/loss interview transcripts
- Customer survey verbatims
- Current positioning statement / pitch deck / board deck
- Competitor narratives (verbatim from sites + decks)

Skills will refuse to run on speculation. They demand evidence.

---

## Roadmap

- **v1** (now): 18 facilitator skills
- **v1.5** (60 days): scoring rubrics, executive summary generators, deliverable formatters
- **v2** (120 days): industry variants (SaaS / DTC / B2B Services), meta-selector skill, CLI runner

---

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Strict template. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The bar: each skill must include framework, core question, 8-9 segments, 5 deliverables, adversarial facilitation rules. Generic frameworks rejected. PRs that don't match the template auto-close.

## Why This Exists

Strategy advice on the internet is mostly platitudes. Real strategy work is adversarial — pressure tests, forensic audits, evidence demands. These 18 frameworks are what Petrichor runs for paying clients.

Open-sourced because reputation engineering is a network effect. The frameworks travel. The credit travels with them.
