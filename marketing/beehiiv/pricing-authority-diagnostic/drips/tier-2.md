## Email 1 — Day 2

**Subject:** Kit + scorecard + private Loom
**Preview:** Watch the Loom first. Six minutes.

Hi {{first_name}},

Tier 2 Compromised is the point where discount discipline alone will not close the gap. The discount creep is downstream of a deeper issue — usually the value metric, sometimes the rev-rec rules, sometimes the discovery process. The kit will surface which. The reconstruction requires cross-functional execution.

Two things:

**1. Watch the Loom — {{loom-url}}.** Six minutes. Helix worked example. Tier 2 Compromised. Discount 8→21% in four quarters. NRR 108→96%. The Loom walks the layered diagnostic, the leadership conversations, and the artifact.

**2. Run the kit — [pricing-authority-diagnostic kit](https://github.com/petrichorprojects/resilience-stack/tree/main/skills/growth/pricing-authority-diagnostic).** 3-hour session. Bring CEO, CFO, head of sales. The scorecard at the end gives you a number per segment (0–3) and a total (0–27). Two things to look for: which segment scored worst, and which segments scored worst together. Clusters tell you whether the compromise is at the discipline layer (segments 1, 2, 6), the value-metric layer (segments 4, 8), or the rev-rec layer (segments 3, 7).

Tomorrow: the two-version pricing reconciliation Petrichor uses at Tier 2.

## Email 2 — Day 4

**Subject:** The two-version pricing reconciliation
**Preview:** Internal price (what reps could close at) vs External price (what the deck claims). Both true.

Hi {{first_name}},

At Tier 2 Compromised, the company is operating with two pricing realities and only acknowledging one. The Internal-Effective price (the average price reps actually close at after discount, by segment) is different from the External-List price (the price on the deck and the website). The gap is the diagnostic. The reconciliation closes it.

**Step 1: Calculate the Internal-Effective price.**

For each segment, compute: median sold price across the trailing 4 quarters of closed-won deals. Not list. Not the top quartile. Median. This is the price your buyers actually pay.

**Step 2: Compute the gap.**

Gap = (External List - Internal Effective) / External List. By segment.

A 5-10% gap is normal headroom for discount discipline. A 15-25% gap means the External-List price has drifted into aspiration. A 30%+ gap means the External-List price is no longer a price — it is a starting point for negotiation that nobody starts at.

**Step 3: Decide which price is real.**

Option A: bring External-List down to closer to Internal-Effective. The list price becomes honest. Discount creep narrows because the reps cannot discount what is already at floor. Risk: NRR optics worsen because price increases on existing customers become smaller in absolute terms.

Option B: bring Internal-Effective up to closer to External-List. Discount discipline reset. Floor pricing reset. Reps incentivized on lower-discount deals. Risk: deal velocity slows in the short term; some deals churn at renewal because the customer was implicitly expecting the discount level to continue.

Option C: bifurcate. New customers get a new pricing model — different list, different value metric, different discount approval rules. Existing customers stay on legacy until renewal. The two prices diverge cleanly.

Each option is a leadership decision with downstream consequences. Petrichor does not pick the option for you. The engagement names the trade-offs and produces the artifact that lets you decide.

The artifact has two parts:

- The Internal-Effective price map. By segment, by motion, by quarter.
- The reconciliation plan. Which option, why, what the 6-month execution path looks like.

Friday: Helix's scorecard.

## Email 3 — Day 7

**Subject:** Helix's Tier 2 scorecard and the three actions
**Preview:** 18/30 Eroding. Discount 8→21%. NRR 108→96%. The fix was the value metric.

Hi {{first_name}},

Helix at the start of the engagement: $28M ARR healthcare scheduling SaaS, six quarters past Series B. Quiz composite: 11/15 Tier 2 Compromised. NRR had cracked below 100% in the trailing quarter.

The full diagnostic scorecard:

| Segment | Score (0–3) | Read |
|---|---|---|
| Discount trend | 3 | 8% → 21% across four quarters |
| Quarter-end pattern | 2 | 18% → 38% in same window |
| NRR cohort | 3 | Deck NRR 102%, cohort NRR 96% |
| Value-metric defensibility | 3 | "Why per provider" failed on three of three follow-ups |
| Price-increase readiness | 2 | "Probably not, the team would talk us out of it" — head of sales |
| Discount reason audit | 3 | Pattern 2 (anchoring at discount) dominated, 6/10 deals |
| Rev-rec rules | 1 | Recently audited, defensible |
| List-vs-floor decomposition | 2 | Reps had been anchoring at 80% of list as "starting point" |
| Competitive concession audit | 2 | "Competitive pressure" claims often did not have a named competitor |

Total: 21/27. The value-metric layer (segment 4) and the anchoring pattern (segment 6) were the leading layers. Discount discipline (segments 1, 2) was the lagging symptom.

Three actions over a 12-week engagement:

**Action 1: Internal-Effective vs External-List reconciliation.** Helix had a 38% gap between External-List and Internal-Effective in the SMB segment, 24% in Mid-Market, 19% in Enterprise. The team chose Option C — bifurcate. New customers got a new pricing model (per active user per month, lower list, tighter discount approval). Existing customers stayed on per-provider until renewal. Reconciliation plan executed across 8 weeks.

**Action 2: Value metric augmentation.** As covered in the Tier 1 case but executed at higher fidelity. Per-active-user option was added alongside per-provider. New deals defaulted to a recommendation engine. The recommendation engine was tracked in CRM to monitor whether the value metric switch was changing close rates.

**Action 3: Discount approval rebuild.** The 15%-threshold VP Sales review rule. The five-pattern reason coding. Quarterly discount autopsy as a recurring deliverable, not a one-time exercise.

Outcomes at 6 months post-engagement:

- Discount average: 21% → 13% on new deals (legacy customers tracked separately).
- Quarter-end approval: 38% → 23%.
- NRR cohort: 96% → 104%.
- The Internal-Effective vs External-List gap closed to 12% in SMB, 9% in Mid-Market, 7% in Enterprise.

The point is not the NRR recovery. It is the diagnosis. The discount discipline reset alone would have moved discount average by 2-3 points for a quarter and reopened. The value-metric augmentation was the structural fix.

Tuesday: engagement shape.

## Email 4 — Day 10

**Subject:** What a Petrichor engagement looks like end-to-end
**Preview:** Eight weeks, three artifacts, one calibrated pricing model.

Hi {{first_name}},

Full engagement shape, no marketing veneer.

**Week 1: data assembly.**

You provide: 4 quarters of closed-won deal-level data (list, sold, discount, segment, motion, rep, approval date and approver, claimed reason), 4 quarters of customer revenue (for cohort NRR rebuild), current rev-rec rules document, current sales enablement materials related to pricing and discount, the last value-metric stress test if you have one. We audit data within 72 hours.

**Week 2: full diagnostic.**

We run all 9 segments in two 4-hour working sessions with CEO, CFO, head of sales. Output: scorecard, layered diagnosis (discipline / value-metric / rev-rec), written hypothesis brief naming leading layer.

**Weeks 3–4: Internal-Effective price map + reconciliation framework.**

We build the price map by segment, motion, and quarter. We build the reconciliation framework (Option A / B / C analysis specific to your situation, with quantified consequences per option). Leadership team decides.

**Weeks 5–6: pricing model rebuild (if Option B or C).**

If reconciliation chose Option A (list-down), the work is shorter — list-price reset, discount-approval rules rewrite, sales enablement update. If Option B (effective-up) or Option C (bifurcate), the work is longer because it involves value-metric work or new-customer pricing model work.

**Week 7: discount discipline reset.**

The five-pattern reason coding. The threshold-and-justification rules. The recurring autopsy deliverable. Sales enablement on anchoring, discovery, and value-anchored close.

**Week 8: ship + measurement plan.**

You ship the reset. We hand off a 90-day measurement plan against the five quiz mechanics plus three Tier 2-specific signals (Internal-Effective price by segment, discount approval response time, value-metric switch rate if value metric was augmented).

Three artifacts you keep: Internal-Effective price map, reconciliation plan, discount discipline document.

Fixed scope, fixed fee. Tier 2 discipline-layer engagements run roughly $50k. Value-metric-layer engagements run roughly $70k. Bifurcation engagements (Option C) run higher because new pricing models require more cross-functional work and we will tell you that on the call.

Saturday: triage call prep.

## Email 5 — Day 14

**Subject:** What to bring to the triage call
**Preview:** Scorecard, three undocumented discounts, the value metric you disagree about.

Hi {{first_name}},

Last email. {{calendly-url}}.

Bring three things.

**1. The kit scorecard.**

Filled in. All 9 segments scored 0–3.

**2. Three undocumented discounts.**

The three largest discounts approved last quarter where the claimed reason did not match the actual reason. Two-line description each — claimed vs actual. The pattern across three tells me where the discipline is breaking faster than the scorecard surfaces.

**3. The value metric your leadership team disagrees about.**

If your team is unanimous on the current value metric, you are not at Tier 2 Compromised — you are at Tier 1 or 0. The disagreement is the diagnostic. Bring the most contested view — CEO wants to keep it, head of sales wants to change it, CFO wants to bifurcate. We read the disagreement together.

Call ends with one of three answers (internal reconstruction / Petrichor engagement / different team).
